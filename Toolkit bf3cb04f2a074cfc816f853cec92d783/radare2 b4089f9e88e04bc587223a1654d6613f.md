Absoultely free that’s why it’s such a darling for many people. However its a command line tool with lots of commands to keep in mind which might make the analysis slower if you are not using it pretty oftern. Also, I am not sure whether they have some scripting functionality included. One of the advantages is that it has several additional tools in the package (like `rabin`). The main advantage is that it can be install on ANY platform (mobile phones or PCs, Macs, Windows, Linux). You can statically examine, for example, an ARM binary on a PC for free, but you need to install `radare` on some ARM device to debug it.
