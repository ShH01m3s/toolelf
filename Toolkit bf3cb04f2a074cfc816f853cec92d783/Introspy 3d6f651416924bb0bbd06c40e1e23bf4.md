This tool consists of two parts: Analyzer and Tracer. Tracer is launched on iDevice or Android to hook all APIs and functions that are dangerous from security prospection. Upon analysis it creates a db that is further can be analyzed by Analyzer on PC.

### Introspy iOS

**Prerequisites on iDevice**: dpkg (to installÂ **deb**), Applist (for Introspy to get all installed applications), PreferenceLoader (to appear in Settings menu) and CydiaSubstrate.

DownloadÂ [link](https://github.com/iSECPartners/Introspy-iOS/releases).

`scp **[**introspy_deb**]** root@**[**device_ip**]**:~
ssh root@**[**device_ip**]**
dpkg -i **[**introspy_deb**]**
killall -HUP SpringBoard`

> ðŸš«Â Error encountered.Â At first, I didnâ€™t see it in the Settings menu, even after rerunningÂ killallÂ several times. I thought itâ€™s just not meant to be. But later after rebooting, rejailbreaking and installingÂ SSL Kill Switch 2, I reran the commandÂ killall -HUP SpringBoardÂ and it worked. I donâ€™t know how or why it wasnâ€™t working at first yet. May be rejailbreaking and restarting worked.

If everything works fine, you should seeÂ **Inrospy - Apps**Â andÂ **Introspy - Settings**Â in the Settings menu of the iDevice in question.
