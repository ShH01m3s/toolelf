There is a good course from Basis Technology about there own tool, of course, and I am sure there are lot’s of other tutorials out there available for free, so, this is not meant to be complete user guide. These are things that I have found notable or important to take into account when analysing a system.

### Correlation Engine

This module gets data from other modules:

- hash values from Hash Lookup IM (ingest module)
- Email addresses (probably, from keyword search)
- SSID (where does it get them from?)
- Central Repo (to check for previous occurrences)

So keep this in mind when using it. If you don’t run some ingest module, CE won’t have this info in its disposal.

### Registry Analysis

1. Queries for hives that are stored in `System32\config`
    1. `System`
    2. `Software`
    3. `Security`
    4. `SAM` - containing user acc info
2. Quieries for `NTUSER.dat` hives
3. Runs a RegRipper profile

### Web Artifacts

This is how Autopsy handles web artifacts (🌵 - supported, 🍎 - unsupported):

So, to conclude, Chrome is the reachest source. Firefox goes next, because it’s almoust that rich (doesn’t keep cache). Edge and IE are don’t have Downloads, Cache, Addresses Auto Fill and Web Form Auto fill tracking and Safari is almoust as bad in that perspective except that it keeps track of the Downloads. So, looks like Chrome and FF are investigators' darlings ❤️ while Windows browsers are hackers' lovebugs 🪲 .
