IR platform – free to use for incident responders. It provides incident responders with a complete set of remediation actions to address infected hosts, malicious files, attacker-controlled network traffic, and compromised user accounts. With Cynet 360, IR teams can get complete visibility of their environment in less than one hour—and it only takes one click to remediate attacks. The central management allows you to distribute other open-source incident response across the environment, and you can build your own remediation policies for automated threat blocking and removal. You can also see the attack scope and all indicators immediately, which vastly reduces investigation time. Cynet also has a 24/7 Incident Response team to assist organizations that have been attacked. Contact them here
